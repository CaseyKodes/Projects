I have just been using these files to run the code in vs code not really sure how else to explain it, 
I think if you build the same as would be done for part0 but use all of these files it should run


things that work
	pause feature
	people show and have the number on them in the elevator
	animation is smooth
	the people do  show outside of the elevator before they get on
	the button lights do light up when person gets on the floor
	program takes a given file name and makes a simulation from that file 
things that do not work
	does not work on command line instructions to run
