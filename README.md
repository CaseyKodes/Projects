Hello, 
My name is Casey, 
Sometimes I code games I like to play for fun and think I should have them displayed here in case of future jobs.

The two text files are needed to make the hang man game run since that is where they get the words to choose from depending on the difficulties. 

Things I am working on:


--- the Black Jack code is finished


--- in the PokerSim code a user can simulate wild cards but they will not be able to complete gaps in straights or straight flushes also working on that.

Please feel free to run this code and modify as you would like tell me if you find any interesting behvaiors. 

Happy Coding
